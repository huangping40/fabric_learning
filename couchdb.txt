couchdb:

1:Document updates (add, edit, delete)  保证原子性
2：存储数据文件是完整的，没有断电坏文件一说
3：Document updates (add, edit, delete) are serialized, except for binary 
   blobs which are written concurrently. 性能有问题 ?
4:Database readers are never locked out and never have to wait on writers 
  or other readers.  --> mvcc
5:B-trees
6:Documents have the advantage of data being already conveniently packaged ,不是分散
7：Compaction 对使用是透明的   

8: CouchDB replication uses the same REST API all clients use.


Master-master replication
Master-slave replication

 Fallacies of Distributed Computing:

    The network is reliable.
    Latency is zero.
    Bandwidth is infinite.
    The network is secure.
    Topology doesn’t change.
    There is one administrator.
    Transport cost is zero.
    The network is homogeneous.

实现：
At the heart of CouchDB is a powerful B-tree storage engine.
对于一棵m阶B-tree，每个结点至多可以拥有m个子结点。
